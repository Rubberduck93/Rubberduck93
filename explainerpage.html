		<h2 class = "headlines"> Motivation </h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text"> The visualization consists of 4 different datasets: </p>
		<li class="text"> <strong> parking.geojson </strong> - All available parking spaces in Copenhagen. </li>
		<li class="text"> <strong> kbh.geojson </strong> - Map of Copenhagen and all the towns within. </li>
		<li class="text"> <strong> zoner.geojson </strong> - All Parkingzones in Copenhagen. </li>
		<li class="text"> <strong> phuse.geojson </strong> - All Parkinghouses in Copenhagen. </li>
		<p class="text"> I chose these datasets because they all share valuable information regarding parking in Copenhagen. </p>
		<p class="text"> The overall goal was to give the end user an overview of all the parking possibilities in one visualization. </p>
		<hr style="height:30pt; visibility:hidden;" />
		<h2 class = "headlines"> Basic stats </h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text"> All of the datasets were found data.kk.dk/dataset and they are all geojson datasets. I have not used any kind of cleaning nor preprocessing for the datasets.
		<br/>	Most of them were clean enough and small enough to handle. It may have been a mistake not to preprocess the <strong> parking.geojson </strong> because of its size (14.33 MB).
		<br/> The most extracted information from the geojsons were the coordinates.
		<br/> From the <strong> parking.geojson </strong> the coordinates were drawn using D3's Path. The brush function counting the parkingspaces were located here.
		<br/> From the <strong> kbh.geojson </strong> the coordinates were too drawn using D3's Path, else the different towns name and population numbers were used for text and coloring.
		<br/> From the <strong> zoner.geojson </strong>
		<br/> From the <strong> phuse.geojson </strong>
		<br/> The order in which each geojson entered the visualization turned out to be very important for accessing data after all datasets were drawn.
		<br/> Parking -> kbh -> zoner -> phuse.

		<h2 class = "headlines"> Visualizations </h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text"> There is a lot of feedback in the visualization, which is important for the end user.
		<br/>	The mouseover effect is especially important, because it allows most information to be hidden.
		<br/>	Only showing information when the user which to get information creates a more relaxed enviroment by not overflowing the visualization and end user with unneccesary information. </p>
		<hr style="height:30pt; visibility:hidden;" />
		<h2 class = "headlines"> Discussion </h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text"> <strong> Good: </strong>
		<br/>	I feel the visualization and the explainerpage turned out nicely as a whole.
			There are links in between each other and links to the Repository. The visualization is simple but compact as it contains more information than meets the eye.
		<br/>
		<strong> Bad: </strong>
		<br/> The <strong> parking.geojson </strong> file is huge (14.33 MB). This causes the webpage to slow down whenever it has to read from the <strong> parking.geojson </strong> file. I should have used some preprocessing here. </p>
