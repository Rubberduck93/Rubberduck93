		<hr style="height:10pt; visibility:hidden;" />
		<h2 class = "headlines"> Motivation </h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text"> The visualization consists of 4 different datasets: </p>
		<li class="text"> <strong> parking.geojson </strong> - All available parking spaces in Copenhagen. </li>
		<li class="text"> <strong> kbh.geojson </strong> - Map of Copenhagen and all the towns within. </li>
		<li class="text"> <strong> zoner.geojson </strong> - All Parkingzones in Copenhagen. </li>
		<li class="text"> <strong> phuse.geojson </strong> - All Parkinghouses in Copenhagen. </li>
		<p class="text"> I chose these datasets because they all share valuable information regarding parking in Copenhagen. </p>
		<p class="text"> The overall goal was to give the end user an overview of all the parking possibilities in one visualization. </p>
		<hr style="height:30pt; visibility:hidden;" />
		<h2 class = "headlines"> Basic stats </h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text"> All of the datasets are geojson and the datasets were found here: data.kk.dk/dataset. I have not used any kind of cleaning nor preprocessing for the datasets.
		<br/>	Most of them were clean enough and small enough to handle. It may have been a mistake not to preprocess the <strong> parking.geojson </strong> because of its size (14.33 MB).
		<br/> The most extracted information from the geojsons were the coordinates.
		<br/> From the <strong> parking.geojson </strong> the coordinates were drawn using D3's Path. The brush function highlighting and counting the parkingspaces were placed here.
		<br/> From the <strong> kbh.geojson </strong> the coordinates were too drawn using D3's Path, else the different towns name and population numbers were used for text and coloring.
		<br/> Mouse-overing the different towns will highlight and show more details.
		<br/> From the <strong> zoner.geojson </strong> the coordinates were too drawn using D3's Path and a mouse-over will highlight and show closer details regarding the zones.
		<br/> The <strong> phuse.geojson </strong> is drawn text with the respective x and y coordinates. The size of the text drawn depends on the size of the individual parkinghouse.
		<br/> The order in which each geojson entered the visualization turned out to be very important for accessing data after all the datasets were drawn.

		<h2 class = "headlines"> Genre </h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text"> <strong> Visual Narrative </strong> </p>
		<li class="text"> <strong> Consistent Visual Platform </strong> - The visual platform essentially stays as it is. All of the end users manipulations reverses back to its original form once it is no longer used.  </li>
		<li class="text"> <strong> Feature Distinction </strong> - The towns are colored with different shades of green depending on the population within and the edge is black to clearly mark the seperation. The zones are drawn on top with a low opacity. </li>
		<li class="text"> <strong> Animated Transitions </strong> - The towns, zones and clickable text (links), animates to a different color when mouse-over, same with mouse-out. </li>
		<p class="text"> <strong> Narrative Structure </strong> </p>
		<li class="text"> <strong> User Directed Path </strong> - links back and fourth </li>
		<img src="userdirectedpath.png">
		<li class="text"> <strong> Hover Highlighting / Details </strong> - highlighting shows tooltip </li>
		<li class="text"> <strong> Captions / Headlines and Annotations </strong> - title and text </li>
		<hr style="height:30pt; visibility:hidden;" />
		<h2 class = "headlines"> Visualizations </h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text"> There is a lot of feedback in the visualization, which is important for the end user.
		<br/>	The mouse-over effect is especially important, because it allows most information to be hidden and creates a good feeling for the user.
		<br/>	Only showing information when the user wish to get information creates a more relaxed enviroment by not overflowing the visualization and end user with unneccesary information. </p>
		<hr style="height:30pt; visibility:hidden;" />
		<h2 class = "headlines"> Discussion </h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text"> <strong> Good: </strong>
		<br/>	I feel the visualization and the explainerpage turned out nicely as a whole.
		<br/> There are links in between eachother and links to the Github Repository.
		<br/> The visualization is simple but compact as it contains more information than meets the eye.
		<br/>
		<br/> <strong> Bad: </strong>
		<br/> The visualization lacks story. The visualization is essentially just a lot of different information gathered one place.
		<br/> There is no deeper purpose for the ordinary person to use this visualization other than getting a bit of information regarding the place he or she may live.
		<br/> It would have improved the visualization if it was possible to get datasets on when and where parkingspaces were taken or free, so each person could easier plan their daily rutine of parking.
		<br/>
		<br/> The <strong> parking.geojson </strong> file is huge (14.33 MB). This causes the webpage to slow down whenever it has to read from the <strong> parking.geojson </strong> file. I should have used some preprocessing here. </p>
